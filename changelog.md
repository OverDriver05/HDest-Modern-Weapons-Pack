**Many weapons may look the same or similar. For example, the SCARs. UMPs, AKs. M240 and M249, etc. The best way to differentiate them is to throw the weapon on the ground and observe the magazine shape. That'll tell you caliber. Alternatively, check the magazine sprite in you HUD when equipped with the weapon.**

    - This required the.45ACP from HDBulletLib
	- Firemodes: Semi

- Modified M107
	- Now uses 50 OMG from HDBulletLib instead of Bryan's 50BMG. This was done to improve continuity between the mods
    - For example, if you have Potetobloke's weapon pack, you can now share ammo between the M107 and the M2HB.
	- The loadout codes and magazine are still the same, except they both now take 50 OMG.

- Modified ACOG
    - Redid sprite. Now has the same base mount width as other attachments, so it better fits with the new weapons.
    - Loadout codes are the same

- Added an ITI Mars. (acr) 
    - Its just an acog.
 	- Without zooming, the RMR is active. While zooming, you switch to the magnified view. This works only if you have the minimal sights option enabled, because it relies on the alt sight code bit thing.
    - Redid sprite. Now has the same base mount width as other attachments, so it better fits with the new weapons. Also added nonfunctional reflex bit to the top.  The RMR on top above the scope sprite is functional, however.

    - Sprites from Girls Frontline, obtained from IOPwiki.
    - You can add it to a weapon with loadout code `bs11`
    - You can add it as a separate item to your loadout with code `vfl`

    - Has a firerate slightly slower than the M4. I can't find data on how fast it would actually fire.
    - Uses the 7.62x51mm silencer. Deal with it.
    - First the 1918 BAR, then the M14, then the M5, what comes next?
